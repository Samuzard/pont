# Pont
_"Pont"_ acts as a bridge between natural language queries and databases. It transforms natural language queries into structured data retrieval by intently discovering and mapping database definitions to real-world business language (rules and terms).
This solution empowers teams to focus on strategy rather than troubleshooting data pipelines. By combining natural language understanding, metadata-driven query generation, and secure data access, Pont reduces the complexity of data retrieval—giving analysts faster access to the information they need.
